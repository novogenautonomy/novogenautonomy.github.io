EVs are more efficient to bring the energy to the wheels compared to ICEs
for fixed mileage. 
BUT
EVs are much heavier then ICE cars.

``
  the more Batteries, the more range, but also more weight.
``

So when we talk about weight, we are actually talking about 
Battery, battery management system and range calculation.

=> goal not to exceed the original overall vehicle weight

1. weight everything you take out of the car so that you know
how much you can put back in
2. the heaviest will be the engine around 200kg and more
3. Transmission around 50 kg
4. 32 kg Engine Accessories
5. Shifter 4 kg
6. Brakets
7. mufflers, exhaust pipe 20 kg
8. gas tank roughly 400 kg (880 lbs)

 64 kg (141lbs) kE-Moto and inverter system =
26 kg Gearbox
8 kg starter battery 
11 kg converter & charger
10 kg cooling system 
25 kg cable

total 144 kg (316lbs)
leaves 250 kg (550lbs) for battery

in an excel sheet: 
- Sedan
- SUV
- Truck
