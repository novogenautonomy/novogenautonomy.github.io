There are two main categories of electric motors, AC and DC;

##  **AC** motors 
- use alternating current to turn its shaft. 
- They generally allow for a high power output, partly because they can utilize three-phase electric power (Gainesville
Industrial Electric Co, 2022). 
- They also allow for regenerative braking which is favorable when trying to maximize range in an EV. 
- They require no “service”, and they can maintain a sustainable temperature during prolonged high loading. 
- The downside is that they can be more expensive, and require more advanced controlling than DC motors.

##  **DC motors** 
- use direct current. 
- In their simplest form they are inexpensive and only need a two-lead wire to turn (positive and negative leads).
- They produce high amounts of torque at low RPMs.
- There is a variety of electric motors, some more applicable in EVs than others.


- There are four types of motors : 
    - brushed DC motors, 
    - brushless DC motors (BLDC), 
    - AC induction motors, and 
    - permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM).

Both permanent magnet DC motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors (AC) are 
- highly efficient but rely on rare earth metals to create the magnetic field. 
- limited in torque to the strength of the magnets => more fit for small, light cars than big, heavy ones (The Engineering Post, 2022). 
- As for the magnets, research is being conducted to eventually replace the rare neodymium with
ferritic materials, although these motors are not yet as power dense (Eriksson and Eklund, 2021).

##  **A brushed DC motor** 
- is the (relatively) least efficient of the listed motors. 
- It does however have a high starting torque, and the simple construction and infrastructure
makes it an affordable and accessible option. 
- It is how many DIY conversions start off (Maguire, 2018). 
- It loses torque and efficiency at high speed, but if the gearbox is
kept in place, the motor can be kept in a rpm range that is the most beneficial.
- Allegedly, the heat created at the commutator can be a cause for concern, and
should be monitored. These are rarely used in production vehicles.

## **An AC induction motor** 
- is widely used in commercial EVs as it is powerful, efficient,
and allows for energy recovery in the form of brake regeneration (The Engineering
Post, 2022). Since there are no brushes that wear down against a commutator, it is,
like the permanent magnet motors, “maintenance free”. 
- The downside is that 
    - it requires an inverter circuit to turn the battery’s DC power to AC. 
    - It is also dependent on hall sensors and fine programming to run properly, increasing both complexity and cost to some degree.
