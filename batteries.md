### Nickel-cadmium batteries
- were earlier used in electric vehicles as they are inexpensive, reliable, and have a long lifespan of around 500-1000 charging cycles
(Petrovich and Chesky, 2019). 
- With a power density of 40-60 Wh/kg they have an advantage over lead-acid batteries but are inferior to other more modern battery types.
- Disadvantages: 
  - they suffer from “memory effect” though where maximum storage capacity depletes due to crystallization if the batteries are not being charged properly. 
  - now prohibited due to cadmium toxicity (Petrovich and Chesky, 2019).

### Nickel-metal hydride batteries
- have a power density of 60-120 Wh/kg and a lifespan of 500-1000 charging cycles. 
- are more expensive than nickel-cadmium batteries but still rather affordable. 
- are suitable for use in electric vehicles as they are reliable and have a large range of operating temperatures and were frequently used in electric vehicles until the breakthrough of the lithium ion battery (Petrovich and Chesky, 2019).
- Disadvantages: 
  - self discharge quickly which can be an issue if the vehicle is parked for a prolonged period of time. 
  - They need precise control of the recharging process making their usage more complex than other batteries.


### Sodium-nickel-chloride batteries (ZEBRA batteries)
- are molten salt batteries with a storage density of roughly 115 Wh/kg 
- a long lifespan of several thousand cycles.
- Problematic is the required high operation temperature of around 300°C. 
- requires preheating after an EV is parked for extended periods of time (especially in cold weather). 
- Therefore the battery is more suitable for EVs that are being used consistently (public transport) (Chian et al. 2019).


## Better options

### Lithium-ion batteries 
- are commonly used in EV today. 
- There is a large variety of chemical compositions and properties of lithium ion batteries on the market
depending on the manufacturer of the battery (Chian et al. 2019). 
- Generally has a long life span of 400-1200 cycles 
- greater energy density than the other types with 100-265 Wh/kg (high energy density comes with high cost). 
- hold a quite consistent voltage over their discharging cycle. 
- are highly reactive and thus require suitable packaging and precise control of the recharging process (Petrovich
and Chesky, 2019). 

### Lead-acid batteries 
- consist of sulfuric acid and water mixture acting as the electrolyte and an anode and cathode covered in lead. 
- Common types of lead-acid batteries include 
  - **flooded lead batteries** => the electrolyte is its (high-density) liquid form which creates a risk for leakage.
  - **AGM** (absorbent glass fiber)=> glass fiber is soaked in the electrolyte eliminating the risk for leakage. 
   - extremely resistant to vibration and maintenance free. 
  - **Gel batteries** => most advanced type of lead-acid batteries with tolerance for high temperatures, shock, vibration and over discharging (Hoffman and Ulander, 2022).
- are used in ICEs to power the starter, ignition system and other electrical components. 
- A standard car battery has 12 Volts and consists of 6 cells with 2.1 Volts each. 
- a lifespan of 400-600 charging cycles (Hoffman and Ulander, 2022).
- Advantages: 
  - they are cheap, easy to produce and recycle,
  - do not need any monitoring (Petrovich, Chesky, 2019). 
- Disadvantage:
  - relatively small capacity with significant bulk and weight only providing around 35-40 Wh/kg. 
  - do not hold consistent voltage over the whole charging cycle making the motor less powerful as the battery discharges (Chian et al. 2019).
